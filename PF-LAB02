## Objective 1

- Task 02 : Take three variables as input and add them without using the + operator (Use your head for this).

- Solution :

       START

// Declaration

Define var1
Define var2
Define var3

// Here’s the Input given by the user

INPUT var1
INPUT var2
INPUT var3

// Initilization
Set SUM to 0    	// Process Steps

sum = var1 - ( - var2) – ( - var3)

// Output

Print “The addition of the given 3 numbers is as follows :” sum;


    END

## Objective 2

• Task 03 : Create a small calculator which only does ‘+’ or ‘-‘ Operations. (Hint: Take three variable inputs with one being used for the operator)

• Solution :

       START

// Declaration

Define operator
Define num1
Define num2



//Input - Here’s the Input given by the user


INPUT number1
INPUT number2
INPUT operator


// Initilization
Set SUM to 0
Set DEDUCT to 0    	// Process Steps

IF operator = “+” 
   THEN
sum = (num1 + num2)
   ENDIF
 
IF operator = “-“
  THEN
deduction =  (num1 – num2)


// Output

Print “The addition of the given 2 numbers is as follows :” sum;

Print “The deduction of the given 2 numbers is as follows :” deduction;

    END

## OBJECTIVE 3

+ Task 01 : Implement an algorithm for determining if an Nth is a divisor of an n Number (i.e. 2 is a divisor of 6). If so, determine if it’s an even number or odd number as well.
- Solution: 
1.	In order to check if n can be divided by N and give zero remainder,we will proceed with an IF statement as following:

IF n % N == 0:
  THEN
  N is a divisor of n

2.	We will again employ if and else case statements to check 

// This means that remainder is zero on division

IF N % 2 == 0: 
  THEN
  N is an even number

ELSE:
  N is an odd number

3.	// Output – Possible Outcomes
EITHER print(“N is a divisor of:” ,n)
EITHER print(“N is an even number”)
EITHER print(“N is an odd number”)

+ Task 03 : Implement an algorithm for making a simple calculator with all the operators (+,-,*,/,%)


- Solution :




1. Ask the user for the first variable (num1)

2. Ask the user for the second variable (num2)

3. Ask the user for the operator to be used (operator)

4. // Process
      
     Result = (num1) (operator) (num2)

5. Display the result to the user.
