1. In order to check if n can be divided by N and give zero
remainder,we will proceed with an IF statement as following:
IF n % N == 0:
THEN
N is a divisor of n
ELSE n % N !== 0:
THEN
N is not a divisor of n
2. We will again employ if and else case statements to check
// This means that remainder is zero on division
IF N % 2 == 0:
THEN
N is an even number
ELSE:
N is an odd number
3. // Output – Possible Outcomes
EITHER print(“N is a divisor of:” ,n)
OR print(“N is not a divisor of:”, n)
EITHER print(“N is an even number”)
OR print(“N is an odd number”)
