// Updated - Objective 3

1.	In order to check if n can be divided by N and give zero remainder,we will proceed with an IF statement as following:

IF n % N == 0:
  THEN
  N is a divisor of n

2.	We will again employ if and else case statements to check 

// This means that remainder is zero on division

IF N % 2 == 0: 
  THEN
  N is an even number

ELSE:
  N is an odd number

3.	// Output – Possible Outcomes
EITHER print(“N is a divisor of:” ,n)
EITHER print(“N is an even number”)
EITHER print(“N is an odd number”)
